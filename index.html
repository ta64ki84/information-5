				<p>Jubulnori is a folk game of New Year to light a fire in a rice paddy or paddy field. When the sun goes down, each village goes out to the fields and sets fires all at once on the dry grass of the fields or paddy fields to burn them. It was believed that this way, there would be no disease all year round and disasters could be repelled. Symbolically, the fire is rotated with a wish to burn bad luck and disaster. It contains the intention to achieve a bountiful harvest by eradicating pest eggs and mice by going out to the field, putting straw, etc. into a can with several small holes, lighting it, and then throwing it away to burn weeds in paddy fields. Depending on the size of the fire, it is also used to foretell the good or bad years of the village, and it is said that the greater the fire, the better. </p>

				<p>Setting fire to daljip (the Moon House, a large bonfire structure) on Jeongwol Daeboreum as the signal, farmers set banks around rice paddies and fields on fire to burn off weeds and habitats where rats and harmful insects thrive; which, in turn, is beneficial to farming. The ashes of burnt weeds are natural fertilizers and absorbed into the ground to help promote the growth of fresh grass and protect banks of paddies and fields. The fire also eradicates field mice that transmit infectious disease. Jwibul Nori also evolved into a team battle, and farmers believed that the winner, or team creating a greater fire, could prevent disastrous happenings within the community, amid expectations for a rich harvest. This may be regarded as a kind of indirect fortune-telling and a mock ritual, where farmers often would predict the year’s harvest and fortune for the coming year, relying on the productive powers of the full moon and fire. </p>

				<blockquote>The customary battle on Jeongwol Daeboreum is also known as Pyeonjeon or Byeonjeon, while the game often developed into a source of entertainment, and even into a team battle to provide a means of fortune-telling. Jwibul Nori is also mixed with Deulbul Nori where torch holders set fire to weeds and grasses on the banks of paddies and fields. This required farmers to make torches from bush clover wood and cedar, and carry them to fields and paddies to burn off weeds. Two teams of farmers holding torches run around to see who can set fire to more areas, or simply compete to try and blow out an opponent’s enemy torches.</blockquote>
